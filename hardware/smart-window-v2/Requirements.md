# Goal
To create an updated design thats functional with all the features of the original board. To boost CV, increasing employability. 

- [ ] Blog Post Detailing Progress and reference material??

### Design Constraints 
- Components from the previous board should be reused within reason 
- Board should not require assembly from the pcb manufacturer 
- board should not cost more than **$50USD**
- Kicad project files should follow phil's best practices
